# STG-on-TLNs

This program determines a state transition graph for a combinatorial threshold linear network subject to the hyperplane arrangement generated by the threshold linearity and the nullclines.  The usable file is stg_main.m.  The primary input are the parameters of the CTLN (epsilon, delta, and theta) along with the adjacency matrix of the directed graph from which the CTLN is derived.  

The output graphic will consist of four images.  The first is a representation of the underlying directed graph.  The second is an undirected graph where each vertex corresponds to a chamber of the hyperplane arrangement.  The presence of an edge indicates that the chamber share a face and are adjacent to one another.  The third is the state transition graph between chambers.  The fourth is the Morse graph which collapses strongly connected components into vertices.
